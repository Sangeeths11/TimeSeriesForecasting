# In this histogram, we see that the residuals are not perfectly normally distributed. There are several bars representing different frequencies of the residuals in different areas.
# 
# A normally distributed distribution should be symmetrical around the mean value. This histogram shows a certain symmetry around the mean value, but also shows some deviations.
# 
# There are some extreme residual values, particularly around -800 and 600, which indicate outliers. These could indicate special events or model errors.
# 
# Most of the residuals seem to be concentrated in the range of about -200 to 200, which indicates that the model does not make extremely large errors in most cases.

# There are some points at the beginning and end (especially for extreme values) that deviate significantly from the line. These outliers indicate that the residuals for the extreme values are not normally distributed.
#

# The first bar at lag 0 always has an autocorrelation of 1, as it is the correlation of the residuals with themselves.
# 
# Most of the autocorrelation values for the different lags lie within the blue confidence interval, which indicates that these autocorrelations are not significant.
# 
# As most of the autocorrelation values lie within the confidence intervals, this indicates that there is no significant autocorrelation in the residuals. This is a good sign as it indicates that the model has captured the time series structure well.

# In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator measures the average of the squares of the errors â that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and what is estimated. The MSE is a measure of the quality of an estimatorâit is always non-negative, and the smaller the MSE, the closer we are to finding the line of best fit.

# Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) tells us that our model was able to forecast the average daily furniture sales in the test set within 160.34 of the real sales. Our furniture daily sales range from around 400 to over 1200. In my opinion, this is a pretty good model so far.
